    AGENDA
         
  - Binding Basics

  - What is Binding Oriented Programming?
  
  - Example: Windows Forms Search Query
  
  - Example: Windows Forms Drop-downs
  
  - Example: WPF Search Query
  
  - Asynchronous binding
  
  - Ruby! Rails! Oh my!
  
  

  






        txtName.Text = customer.Name
        
                    ...
        
        customer.Name = txtName.Text







            HOW WOULD YOU DO IT?













      - INotifyPropertyChanged
        
        Allows an OBJECT to notify a TARGET 
        that one of its properties have 
        changed.
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
      - INotifyCollectionChanged (.NET 3.0)
      - IBindingList 
        
        Allow a COLLECTION to notify a TARGET
        that its items have changed.
        
        
        
       
       
       
      
        
        
        
        
        
        
      - IDataErrorInfo
        
        Allows an OBJECT to tell a TARGET 
        that it has errors.

        BINDING ORIENTED PROGRAMMING
        
        TRENDS:
        
      - "UI code isn't designed, it happens"
      
      - UI requirements becoming more COMPLEX
        
      - CODE becoming UNMAINTAINABLE
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        Laws of BINDING ORIENTED PROGRAMMING
        
        
      - Codebehind is BAD
        
      - Synchronization MATTERS
      
      - Prefer a "pull" approach to a "push" 
        approach
        
      - UI Driven Development
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        Search Query: REQUIREMENTS
        
        
   1. Fill in First and Last name, click SEARCH
   
   2. Clicking “Cancel” stops the search.
   
   3. TYPING stops the search.
   
   4. Search is ASYNC.
   
   5. Display progress bar ONLY WHILE 
      SEARCHING
